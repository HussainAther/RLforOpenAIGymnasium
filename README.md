# Reinforcement Learning for OpenAI Gymnasium LunarLander-v2

Welcome to the repository for the Reinforcement Learning project focused on solving the OpenAI Gymnasium LunarLander-v2 environment.

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop reinforcement learning algorithms to solve various OpenAI Gym environments, starting with Gymnasium's LunarLander-v2 environment. The objective is to train an AI agent to navigate and land a lunar module safely on the surface of the moon while maximizing the reward. Traditional reinforcement learning techniques often face challenges with sparse feedback, hindering efficient adaptation to changing environments. This project explores the incorporation of additional intrinsic rewards based on state visitation frequency to enhance the feedback loop.

## Project Structure

The project follows a structured approach, including the following components:

1. **Problem Identification:** Formulation of problem statement, context, criteria for success, scope of solution space, constraints, stakeholders, and data sources.
2. **Data Wrangling:** Data exploration and preparation, utilizing simulated sensor data from the LunarLander-v2 environment provided by OpenAI Gymnasium.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualization and analysis of observations, rewards, and actions using Gymnasium's built-in functionalities.
4. **Pre-processing and Training Data Development:** Pre-processing observations and splitting data into training, validation, and test sets.
5. **Modelling:** Selection and implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks, Policy Gradient methods), training the AI agent, and evaluation of performance.
6. **Documentation:** Creation of a comprehensive project report, including problem formulation, methodology, results, and discussion. Additionally, clear and concise documentation for the codebase will be provided, including comments and explanations.
7. **Deliverables:** GitHub Repository containing code for each step of the project, a slide deck summarizing project objectives and results, and a project report detailing problem formulation, methodology, results, and discussion.
